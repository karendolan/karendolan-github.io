This project uses visualizations to investigate immigration, migration, demographics, and work over time in a geographic location. The dataset “[Nevada Census Microdata]( https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/27218)” provides a large set of data extracted from manuscript census pages from the state of Nevada, for the federal censuses of 1860, 1870, 1880, 1900, 1910, and 1920.

The code includes libraries [D3](https://d3js.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
, topographic libraries [World](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas) and [US States](https://github.com/topojson/us-atlas).
